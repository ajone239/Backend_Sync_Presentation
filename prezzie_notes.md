## Your terminal is your friend.

- You should get to know your friend. The terminal is a main line to
  your computer -- an effective tool.
- It\'s all there. The terminal is one box for most of your tools.
- Your friend wants to help you. You have to know how to ask it for
  help.

## How you flow through your work.

- I can\'t willingly do something my computer can do better.
- Homogenous workflows increase productivity.
  - Ex PRs
  - Humans suck at context switching.
- Less mouse is better.
- Less seams in a workflow.

better.
